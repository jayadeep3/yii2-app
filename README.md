# yii2-app

The repository yii2-app appears to be a project for deploying an application using Ansible playbooks and includes a CI/CD pipeline. Here's a step-by-step summary of the repository based on its      README:

1. Install Ansible on your Local Machine

    Before running the Ansible playbooks, ensure that Ansible is installed on your control machine (e.g., your local system or a server from which you will run the commands).
    Step-by-Step Installation:
    On Ubuntu/Debian:

    Update your system:

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt upgrade -y

    Install Ansible:

        sudo apt install ansible -y

    On CentOS/RHEL:

    Enable the EPEL repository

        sudo yum install epel-release -y

    Install Ansible:

        sudo yum install ansible -y

    On macOS:

    Use Homebrew to install Ansible

        brew install ansible

    Verify Installation:

        ansible --version

    Ensure that the version is displayed correctly to confirm a successful installation.

2. Configure Ansible Setup

    Prepare the hosts.ini inventory file for your target servers (as described earlier).
    Ensure you have proper SSH access to the target servers. This may involve setting up SSH keys or providing the correct credentials.

3. Running Ansible Playbooks

    The repository includes several Ansible playbooks to set up and deploy the application. These are executed as follows:

    Install Docker:

        ansible-playbook ansible/install_docker.yml

    Install NGINX:

        ansible-playbook ansible/install_nginx.yml

    Set up Docker Swarm:

        ansible-playbook ansible/setup_swarm.yml

    Deploy the application:

        ansible-playbook ansible/deploy_app.yml

4. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

    The repository is configured such that pushing to the main branch will automatically trigger a build and deployment process.

5. Testing the Deployment

    After deployment, you can verify the application by accessing it through the public IP or domain in a browser.
